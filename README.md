It shows no controls (test 1), dynamically unstable system (test 2, 3, and 4), undamped oscillations (test 4), and properly damped oscillations (test 6 and 7).  Tests 6 and 7 result in a craft hovering at a specified altitude.

X-Y scatter plot of altitude and latitude. Wait, which one is latitude again? Oh, right. Number four is X-Y scatter plot of altitude (in meters) and longitude (in degrees). This (roughly) approximates the trajectory of a Falcon 9 booster returning to launch site.
