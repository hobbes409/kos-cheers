2018/01/30  Testing Microsoft Visual Studio Code as a text editor
2018/01/30  Attempted to configure github to use "E:\My Documents\GitHub\kos-cheers" as the local repository for kos-cheers.  
2018/01/30  Can't use craft files from CheersKevin YouTube channel, incompatible game version.
2018/01/30  Changed kP to 0.01, kI to 0.00001, kD to 0.01.  Successful hover!  Hover altitude was low by value of P.
2018/01/30  Changed kP to 0.001, kI to 0.001, starting altitude to 100, stage when LIQUIDFUEL remaining < 2.  
2018/01/30  Data plotted here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT3p-68Y8yJsHSMP8lcNAej09bipXM0G5m5SqzhmRsaYitB99w4iv860hc9a8ICuSiga4d9MLwm5Wwo/pubchart?oid=1215296613&format=interactive

2018/01/29  For episodes 8 & 9, STAGE:LIQUIDFUEL returns 0 in all conditions, can't find why.  Used SHIP:LIQUIDFUEL instead.
