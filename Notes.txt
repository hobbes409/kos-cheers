2018/02/11  Crashed Excel trying to create charts.  Each flight has approx 15,000 entries each with 5 data points.  Will try updating script to record data at lower frequency.

2018/02/10  Inspired by SpaceX, recorded some data using MechJeb ascent and landing guidance for recovering boosters.  file:kos3.ks
2018/02/10  X-Y scatter plot of altitude and distance over ground.  Strange looking flight trajectories.  Scale is out by x100. 
2018/02/10  Which one is longitude again?  Oh yeah.  Trajectories look better now.  Changed distance over ground from degrees to meters.
2018/02/10  Plotted velocity (technically SHIP:AIRSPEED) and fuel remaining on same graph.
2018/02/10  Plotted velocity over time with and without airbrakes.
2018/02/10  MechJeb has trouble with airbrake if they are activated after landing guidance begins.  
2018/02/10  MechJeb landing guidance won't accelerate upwards, 
2018/02/10  if horizontal burn won't return to launchpad it gives up and lands anywhere it can.
2018/02/10  Graphs will be uploaded tomorrow.

2018/01/30  Testing Microsoft Visual Studio Code as a text editor
2018/01/30  Attempted to configure github to use "E:\My Documents\GitHub\kos-cheers" as the local repository for kos-cheers.  
2018/01/30  Can't use craft files from CheersKevin YouTube channel, incompatible game version.
2018/01/30  Changed kP to 0.01, kI to 0.00001, kD to 0.01.  Successful hover!  Hover altitude was low by value of P.
2018/01/30  Changed kP to 0.001, kI to 0.001, starting altitude to 100, stage when LIQUIDFUEL remaining < 2.  
2018/01/30  Data plotted here:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT3p-68Y8yJsHSMP8lcNAej09bipXM0G5m5SqzhmRsaYitB99w4iv860hc9a8ICuSiga4d9MLwm5Wwo/pubchart?oid=1215296613&format=interactive

2018/01/29  For episodes 8 & 9, STAGE:LIQUIDFUEL returns 0 in all conditions, can't find why.  Used SHIP:LIQUIDFUEL instead.
2018/01/29  Created a custom craft, which did not successfully hover.
2018/01/29  Downloaded kerbot.craft from https://github.com/gisikw/ksprogramming/tree/master/episodes/e009 to test tomorrow.
