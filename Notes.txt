2018/01/30  Can't use craft files from CheersKevin YouTube channel, incompatible game version.
2018/01/30  Changed kP to 0.01, kI to 0.00001, kD to 0.01.  Successful hover!  Hover altitude was low by value of P.  See KOS2_EP9_PID_testflight-1.csv

2018/01/29  Downloaded kerbot.craft from https://github.com/gisikw/ksprogramming/tree/master/episodes/e009 to test tomorrow.
